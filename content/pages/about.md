This site provides a demo for the [abridge theme](https://github.com/Jieiku/abridge) for [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/) the static site generator.

Abridge was created by [Jake G (jieiku)](https://github.com/Jieiku) to be fast and lightweight, using semantic html, a class-light [abridge.css](https://github.com/Jieiku/abridge.css), and No Mandatory JS.

Some fun facts about the theme:

* Perfect score on Google's Lighthouse audit
* Only ~6 KB of CSS before enabling the SVG CSS icons and syntax highlighting.
* No mandatory JavaScript.
* Now with SEO!

Nearly half of the existing Zola MIT themes were inspiration for features and design of this theme.
